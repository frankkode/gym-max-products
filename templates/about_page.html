        	<p>At GYM Max, we work to inspire and motivate you for better health. We are a team of personal health coaches, exercise instructors, masseurs, 
          Shiite therapists, naprapaths and chiropractors. Since we all specialize in our fields, together we can give you so much more than what you get at a regular gym.
           We want you to feel good both physically and mentally. With us you can train individually or in groups, together with a personal trainer or perhaps with your colleague.
            Our methodology is based on letting you decide the guidelines and based on these we are more than happy to help. Our goal is to make the road there as simple and fun-filled as possible for you.</p>

        <p class="text-muted mb-5 pb-2">Each PT-session lasts 55 minutes. You receive help related to motivation, technique, exercises and training routines. Together, we tailor a program and set goals that suits you. During your first session, you fill out a health statement to ensure that your personal trainer will receive a full picture of your training background, lifestyle and your goals. Based on your goals, you and your personal trainer will agree on how many times and how long you will train together.

 

Depending on what you want to focus on, you can test your fitness, strength, mobility or stability. Together, you follow up on the tests to ensure that you are moving in the direction you want.

 

The agreement with a personal trainer is personal and the period of validity is 1 year from signing of the contract.</p>

        <p class="text-muted mb-5 pb-2 ">A two-day method training on team development in practice.
You get the entire toolbox with effective tools, tasks and models for effective theme development.

What does the task look like that makes it fun to define the group's goals? Which areas are most rewarding for working with the group? How much does the leader need to be prepared? What does a smart follow-up look like?
There are many questions about how to work with a working group in the room. And certainly just as many answers ...
We have compiled experiences from hundreds of team developments, with everything from management groups to working groups, immature and mature teams. Small and large.
We share all of these experiences linked to a single ambition; That you can create as much development power as possible for a team in a limited time.
With you after the training you have with you a constantly updated toolbox with exercises, tasks, models, handouts and work materials, which you can use directly in the work with team development.
Method training links directly to the use of Teambook to create long-term sustainable processes.
